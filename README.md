**Implement the task manager application :**

- Singleton Pattern: Use a singleton to manage the collection of tasks, ensuring there's only one instance of the task manager throughout the application.
- Factory Method Pattern: Implement a factory method to create task objects with different properties.
- Observer Pattern: Use the observer pattern to notify observers (e.g., UI elements) when tasks are added, updated, or deleted.
- Command Pattern: Use the command pattern to encapsulate CRUD operations as command objects, allowing for easy undo/redo functionality in the future.
